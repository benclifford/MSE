osmgateway - imports data from OSM live service to local cache tables

0. acquire API credentials (including a secret) from OSM HQ for this
     application.

1. osmgateway-authorise  to authorise your account to be accessed by
   this application.
   Note that this involves putting your real OSM
   password into my code, which is not OSM. That's fine for my
   personal use but a bit dodgy if this was some third party service.

   OSM API bug: OSM returns 200 even when there is an error such as
     ["{\"error\":\"Missing email\\/token\"}"]

   c.f. github third-party auth flow

2. store the secret and user id returned by osmgateway-authorise
   somewhere

3. set permissions in OSM for this application: read only access to
    Personal Details should be all that is needed.

4. run osmgateway-exe to run whatever functionality has been
   implemented so far.
